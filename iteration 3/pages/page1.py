Due to the current housing prices in the Netherlands, and, and the fact that he just started working, he still lives together with his parents. They live in a large detached house with no neighbours in the village of Harmelen (close to Utrecht).",
    "John's parents are generally in good health, but their age means they are no longer the fittest. John's father started having some trouble walking. Both wear glasses and prefer to take the bus rather than their own cars these days, as driving a car has become more difficult.",
    "John works 40 hours per week and commutes daily to his work by using the train and tram. He loves his work and the colleagues he works with. In his spare time, he goes out for a cycle and meets up with his friends to drink a beer.",
    "On Friday night, John was playing games on Discord with his internet friends. He was doing this on his laptop alone in his dark room. It was good timing to have a call with his friends. It was already raining for days, so it was not a good idea to go outside.",
    "He was having a good time and enjoying the moment. His parents were already asleep and not bothering him. Time flew by. Suddenly, at 2:33, John's internet lost connection. This happens often, as his house is rather old and has a bad connection to the internet.",
    "As John was quite tired, he ultimately decided to go to bed. Before he wanted to go to bed, he walked downstairs to go to the toilet. John noticed something weird when he walked downstairs. The floor was filled with 3cm of water. He looked outside and saw that the meadow and street around his house were filled with water",
    "He didn't believe what he was experiencing and turned on the lights in his house. However, the house stayed dark and John realised that the electricity wasn't working anymore. John then quickly checked his phone, his 5G connection was still working, and he found out that flooding struck the area he lives in. He reads on the news that it will continue with rain and that the water level will keep rising",
    "John slightly started to panic, as he didn't know what to do. He has never experienced flooding before. He walked upstairs and woke up his parents. He asked them what they should do, as the water level is rising and his dad has trouble with walking.",
